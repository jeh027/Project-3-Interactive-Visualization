    <p>
        Our group decided to visualize a graph of energy consumption from fossil 
        fuels for each country over time. This will allow readers to dictate 
        whether the country of their choosing is consuming too much fossil 
        fuel. We decided to plot discrete data points onto a line graph to better 
        demonstrate trend over time, with additional details as a pop-up as 
        users hover over each data point. An alternative is having the annotation 
        be hovered over the user's pointer which is how alternative visualization 
        software like Tableau does, but we decided against this because we 
        believed that some of the detail is too long which may block the user 
        from seeing the graph.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another interaction detail is rooted in the dropdown bar which allows 
        users to select the country which they would be interested in 
        visualizing. We decided the dropdown would be the best option because 
        it's the most intuitive option over alternatives like clicking one from 
        100+ options on the side of the page or typing in the specific country 
        the user would be interested in. We also chose to adjust the y-axis of each visualization for each 
        country due to some countries consuming too much or too little fossil 
        fuel relative to each other, which makes the visualization harder to 
        read. We understand that this may cause confusion among readers, so we 
        put a disclaimer under the visualization so to warn them of this design 
        choice before comparing between countries.
    <p>
        Beyond our current work, we would like to explore this visualization 
        further by extending the option to compare and contrast multiple 
        countries, and possibly modifying the interaction technique to include 
        another dropdown menu or having the option to select multiple options 
        from one dropdown. It may also be interesting to compare each country's 
        fossil fuel consumption to that of the world's.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our group created this visualization using D3's library, Javascript,
        and CSS for styling. The dataset shown here is from the Data on Energy
        dataset by Our World in Data, a non profit organization. When our first
        received the dataset, we imported it into Jupyter Notebooks and cleaned
        the data using Pandas and Numpy, eliminating unnecessary columns, NaN
        values, and countries with less than 38 recored years. We decided to
        do this because we found that some countries only recorded a few years of
        energy consumption and thus, doesn't communicate any meaningful trends to 
        the user.
    </p>
    <p>
        Afterwards, we created a GitHub repository to import the data into Javascript, 
        with the command d3.csv(). With Javascript, we implemented a dropdown button
        containing a list of countries. Behind the scenes, Javascript filters through 
        the dataset, retreiving only the data associated with the country selected by 
        the user. To ensure that all the data fits into the plot, Javascript calculates
        the maximum value and scales the y-axis accordingly using d3.scaleLinear(). As 
        for the x-axis, the years are scaled from 1965 to 2022 using d3.scaleLinear(). The 
        data is then plotted onto the visualization through a dot svg, line svg, and tooltip
        to enhance interactivity. Our visualization is designed so that wherever a user
        selects a new country, the y-axis will reorient itself, for each country's energy
        consumption varies dramatically, allowing the user to effective see trends over
        time from the connected scatter plot.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each group member spent about the same amount of time contributing to the visualization.
        Danny took lead cleaning the dataset while Jesse worked on the data visualization, 
        collectively spending around 15 to 20 hours developing this application. Looking back, we 
        both agree that implementing the dynamic y-axis was the aspect that took the most time 
        for us.
